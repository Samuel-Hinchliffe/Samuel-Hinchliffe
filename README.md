My name is Samuel Hinchliffe and I work as a Software Engineer / Full Stack Developer for [PRIME AI](https://www.primeai.co.uk/). I'm from the United Kingdom. If you wish, come connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-hinchliffe-2bb5801a5/)

## üòÅ A little bit about me

Apart from coding, I spend a lot of my time reading, learning new things and spending time with the people who I love most. I'm a great lover of art, psychology and philosophy. I love discussing crazy ideas and profound theoretical questions. Do dreams really mean anything?
